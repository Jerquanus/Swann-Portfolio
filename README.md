Usage:

For this project the goal was to create a useable portfolio with reactive elements
and the ability to changes size. 

I happened to have an older twitter header handy so I used that as a banner.
My goal was to add a reactive sticky nav bar but failed. So I settled for a just a reactive
nav bar then added my own features to it. 

I used this project to practice my flexbox abilites. I put my main content in a 
flex box to give me more control. Then placed my projects in a flexbox as well. I'm
hoping that helps me in the future when we update the portfolio. 

I also used materalize to help me with creating cards. I'd like to create a better looking card in the future but this suffices for now.
