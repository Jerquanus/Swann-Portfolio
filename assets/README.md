Usage:

For this project the goal was to create a useable portfolio with reactive elements
and the ability to changes size. 

I happened to have an older twitter header handy so I used that as a banner.
My goal was to add a reactive sticky nav bar but failed. So I settled for a just a reactive
nav bar then added my own features to it. 




I also used this project to practice my flexbox abilites. I put my <main> content in a 
flex box to give me more control. Then placed my <projects> in a flexbox as well. I'm
hoping that helps me in the future when we update the portfolio. 

I also made sure that my words in my <about me> were flexible and moved as the page size changed.


For this homework activity. I've definitely put in over
20 hours studying, reading instagram posts, playing coding games, and and watching youtube vidoes to educate myself.
